## Description

My motivation for this project was to edit the code of an existing website. The website did function as it was, however there were changes and additions that could've been made to better interact with serach engines. I've also made it so that changes can be made easier in the future via documentation.

Over the course of this project I've learned a great deal about correct elements to use in the place of 'div' elements.

## Installation 

Installation is quite simple:

If it's the website you wish to access rather than the source code follow these instructions instead:

1: Copy link provided along with this repository
